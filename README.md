Read Until
==========

Adaptive sampling enables a large number of applications, traditionally associated with complex molecular biology methods, to be carried out by the sequencer itself.  Adaptive sampling enables the following: 

**Enrichment**:  Users can ask the system to enrich for strands that contain a target region of interest, a haplotype of choice or an organism of interest against a complex background 

**Depletion**: Users can reject strands from an organism which is of no interest (e.g. host depletion).  In the case of pathogen detection or microbiome applications in human health this could be enabled as a "human filter" ensuring that this sensitive, confidential data is never committed to disk.

**Balancing**: Users can use adaptive sampling to balance their barcodes, ensuring they achieve target depths for each barcode and also even out coverage across a genome by rejecting strands representing regions of the genome already at their target depth in favour of regions that have lower coverage.

The read until API is provided "as is" as a research tool. Issue reporting has been disabled on the github website; users with questions should go to the Nanopore community and post comments [here](https://community.nanoporetech.com/posts/adaptive-sampling-release). Usage currently requires some advanced programming capability. Efforts are ongoing by the Oxford Nanopore team to release simpler versions of this tool enabling more and more users to deploy it successfully.

Please add new feature requests to the feature request pinboard under the tag "Adaptive Sampling" (link)

The Read Until API provides a mechanism for an application to connect to a
MinKNOW server to obtain read data in real-time. The data can be analysed in the
way most fit for purpose, and a return call can be made to the server to unblock
the read in progress.

Installation
------------

The client requires MinKNOW for MinION 20.06 or later (MinKNOW-Core 4.04).

The package can be installed into a python3 virtual environment For example on Ubuntu:

```bash
python3 -m venv read_until_env
source read_until_env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
# Install from github:
pip install git+https://github.com/nanoporetech/read_until_api
# Or from a local clone
python setup.py install
```

Two demonstration programs are provided (and are installed into
MinKNOW/ont-python/bin/):

   1.  `read_until_simple`: this serves as a simple test, and the code
       (module `read_until.simple`) demonstrates use of basic functionality
       for developers.
   2.  `read_until_ident`: this is a rather more fully featured example, using
       the API to identify reads via basecalling and alignment. To run it
       requires the optional dependencies of scrappy and mappy. To use the 
       `scrappy` basecaller efficiently it is important to set 
       the blas library to be single threaded, this is ordinarily done with:

           export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1

       or similar.


Client Overview
---------------

The python Read Until package provides a high level interface to requisite parts
of MinKNOW's [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) interface. Developer's can focus on
creating rich analyses, rather than the lower level details of handling the data
that MinKNOW provides. The purpose of the read until functionality is to
selectively, based on any conceiveable analysis, "unblock" sequencing channels
to increases the time spent sequencing analytes of interest. MinKNOW can be
requested to send a continuous stream of "read chunks" (of a configurable
minimum size), which the client can analyse.

The main client code is located in the `read_until.base.ReadUntilClient` class,
which can be imported as simply:

    from read_until import ReadUntilClient

The interface to this class is thoroughly documented, with additional comments
throughout for developers who wish to develop their own custom client from the
gRPC stream. Developers are encouraged to read the code and inline documentation
(a HTML version of which can be built using the `docs` make target). 

The gRPC stream managed by the client is bidirectional: it carries both raw data
"read chunks" to the client and "action responses" to MinKNOW. The client
implements two queues. The first is the `.action_queue` and is fairly
straight-forward: requests to MinKNOW to unblock channels are temporarily stored
here, bundled together and then dispatched.

The second queue is more elaborate, it is implemented in
`read_until.base.ReadCache`. The client stores read chunks here in preparation
for analysis. The queue is additionally keyed on channel such that it only ever
stores a single chunk from each sequencer channel; thereby protecting consumers
of the client from reads which have already ended. A restriction of this
approach is that consumers cannot combine data from multiple chunks of the same
read. If this behaviour is required, a client can be constructed with an
alternative implementation of a `ReadCache` (passed as a parameter on
construction of the `ReadUntilClient` instance). However since the effectiveness
of a read until application depends crucially on the latency of analysis, it is
recommended to design analyses which require as little data as possible and set
the received chunk size accordingly.

For many developers the details of these queues may be unimportant, at least in
getting started. Of more immediate importance are several methods of the
`ReadUntilClient` class:

*`.run()`*
instruct the class to start retrieving read chunks from MinKNOW.

*`.get_read_chunks()`*
obtain the most recent data retrieved from MinKNOW.

*`.unblock_read()`*
request that a read be ejected from a channel.

*`.stop_recieving_read()`*
request that no more data for a read be sent to the client by MinKNOW. It is not
guaranteed that further data will not be sent, and in the general case the
client does not filter subsequent data from its consumers (although when the
client is created with the `one_chunk` option, the client will provide
additional filtering of the data received from MinKNOW).

Examples of use of the client are given in the codebase, but most simply can be
reduced to:

    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    import numpy
    from read_until import ReadUntilClient

    def analysis(client, *args, **kwargs):
        while client.is_running:
            for channel, read in client.get_read_chunks():
                raw_data = numpy.fromstring(read.raw_data, client.signal_dtype)
                # do something with raw data... and maybe call:
                #    client.stop_receiving_read(channel, read.number)
                #    client.unblock_read(channel, read.number)
    
    read_until_client = ReadUntilClient()
    read_until_client.run()
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.submit(analysis, read_until_client)


Extending the client
--------------------

The `ReadUntilClient` class has been implemented to provide an abstraction which
does not require an in-depth knowledge of the MinKNOW gRPC interface. To extend
the client however some knowledge of the messages passed between MinKNOW and a
client is required. Whilst the provided client shows how to contruct and decode
basic messages, the following (an extract from Protocol Buffers definition
files) serves as a more complete reference.

**Messages sent from a client to MinKNOW**
